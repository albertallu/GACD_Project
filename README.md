In this repo you can find the R-script for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera.

The run_analysis.R can be run within R using:

    source("run_analysis.R")
The directory must be the one containing the folder produced by the unzipping of the file <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" target="_blank">https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip</a>.

The script conforms with the 5 requirements for the exercise:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
